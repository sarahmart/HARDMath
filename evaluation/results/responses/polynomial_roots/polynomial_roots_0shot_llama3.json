This grade's final score should be between 0 to 1. You need to consider both the small and large epsilon solution. For each solution, if it  completely matches the elements in ground truth give full credit, give half credit if it gets partially correct and give no credit if it's completely wrong.

Note that the expressions are single-term approximations for each root.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of how I obtained these results:\n\nFor large positive  $ epsilon$ , we can neglect the term $ - x^{2}$  compared to  $ epsilon x^{3}$ , which dominates the polynomial. This simplifies the cubic equation to $ (x - 1/\\sqrt[3]{\\epsilon})^3 + 4\\epsilon \\approx 0$ . Taking the cube root of both sides gives us an approximate expression for each root.\n\nFor small positive  $ epsilon$ , we can neglect  $ epsilon x^{3}$  compared to $ - x^{2} - 1$ , which dominates the polynomial. This simplifies the quadratic equation $ x^2 + 1 = \\epsilon x^3$  to $ (x - (-1))^2 + 4\\approx 0$ . Taking the square root of both sides gives us an approximate expression for each root, which can be further simplified by noting that the root  $ sqrt[3]{-1}$  is a cube root of unity and can be approximated as $ -1$ .\n\nI hope this helps!
